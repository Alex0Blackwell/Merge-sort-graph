## Overview
This project is a website that visualizes the steps of a merge sort. The algorithm sorts columns of differing heights in ascending order. The initial order of the columns is random and can be randomized when the merge sort is not running. This program can help to understand the steps the merge sort algorithm takes.

## Examples

> Recording of the sorting animation on desktop
